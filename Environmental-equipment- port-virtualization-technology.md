Environmental monitoring equipment and remote access technology
===============================================================

Considering how crucial environmental monitoring has become, specialized monitoring equipment is becoming a must-have tool when it as far as our immediate environment and planet are concerned. A wide range of special tools are used to automatically monitor a number of parameters such as rising sea levels, temperature changes, pollutants, greenhouse gases, and so on.

Environmentalists, as well as extraction companies and weather forecast experts, are known to regularly make use of various environmental analyzers, samplers, detectors and monitors.

Whether they are deployed on survey and drilling vessels or in onshore laboratory environments, multi-parameter data are collected by complex testing systems and sent to specialized data centers. This way, researchers get to access and monitor projects from any location, and in real-time. However, putting such automated systems in place can prove to be a daunting task for engineers.


## Remote control challenge

When specialized equipment is built for the monitoring of the environment, they are usually incorporated with standard COM (RS485, RS232, etc.) or USB interfaces. These ports allow the environmental equipment to be connected to a monitoring application installed on a specialist machine. The direct connection that exists between a dedicated control software and a testing device makes it possible for received data to be transmitted from that equipment to a data center.

However, there are some situations where you may be required to establish a connection with various environmental hardware remotely, or you may have to connect to the same device via several control apps at a time. To overcome such challenges, there's a need for the control software to be capable of supporting a dedicated port redirection technology that will allow any COM interface to be accessed over the network.
