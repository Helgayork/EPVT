IMPROVING YOUR POS SYSTEM SOFTWARE WITH ELTIMA TECHNOLOGY – EPVT INTEGRATION
============================================================================

A bad day at the mall will be trying to check out with your goods at the point of sale and finding out that the hardware equipment are faulty. It does not matter what kind of hardware – barcode scanner, scales, cash register or scales, they make our lives easier. This situation justifies the growing demands for a dedicated POS system. The use of specialized POS software by points of sale is on the rise.
The software used for POS systems provide remote control over the POS equipment, track data streams, collect information from each device, and ensure seamless communication between all parts of a POS system.

TOP CHALLENGES FACED BY POS SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
-----------------------------------------------
Devices such as electronic sales, payment terminals, etc used at POS points often come with a specific type of serial port. Com ports also provide a connection medium between the POS equipment to a POS computer system. A POS software redirect streams of serial data coming from the POS device. Transmitting streams of serial protocols across the network and tracking down the serial data that comes through them.
The POS system software requires a dedicated serial port virtualization technology that enables COM ports access the POS devices remotely.


EFFECTIVE SOLUTION
------------------
[Etima software’s Port Virtualization technology](https://www.eltima.com/pos-software-port-virtualization-technology/) can provide any network with access to remote COM ports, thus enabling it to be able track the activity of any serial part shared over Internet or the Ethernet.
The POS software can produce numerous virtual connections and receive the stream of necessary serial data over the network based on the EPVT. As a result, any local machine will be able to detect remote serial ports just like its own.
EPVT controls all data streams from the COM ports of the remote serial devices. The technology also aids the separation of data streams into one data flow and vice versa.
The EPVT provides multiple virtual COM ports on a local PC. While connected to virtual serial ports, scales, payment terminals, remote barcode scanners, payment terminals, other POS hardware devices are displayed in a local computer as though they were attached to the machine physically. Custom development of specialized applications for serial communication between POS computers and devices is made possible by the integration of the EPVT into the point of sale software.
