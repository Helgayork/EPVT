Access and manage all industrial bakery equipment from single host point
========================================================================
There has been a gradual rise in the automation of processes. Lots of mechanical equipment and automated process are now being used in place of human labor. Such automation makes it possible to save time, as well as save money while producing high-quality products. 
 In the bakery industry, for instance, the seamless interaction of processes is of utmost importance. The adoption and use of automated industrial lines for baked goods production make it possible for the production process to be managed in a more economical and efficient manner. 
 
Access and manage all bakery equipment 
--------------------------------------
## Real challenge

Typically, the automation of bakery lines is built on the basis of complex mechanism which is controlled by high-end industrial computers (controllers). With the controllers in place, it is possible to manage and closely monitor the operation of a range of industrial bakery equipment, such as packaging and conveying, proofing and baking, cooling and freezing systems, and so on. All communications that take place between production lines and PLCs is usually carried out via serial ports. 
For instance, a constant speed conveyor produces a variety of products in different sizes of pans. Pan sizes are detected by the sensors along the conveyor, and then report the data a PLC that's in charge of controlling the speed of the line. The PLC is responsible for adjusting the line speed to control the bake time. 
In this case, for instance, some serial communication glitches may occur, which may give rise to some issues such as over baking. To avoid such scenario, it's important for manufacturers of bakery product to upgrade their control equipment using a specialized port redirection technology that helps to improve the efficiency of serial connections.

## Efficient solution
When it comes to resolving any issues regarding serial connections, Eltima Port Virtualization Technology (EPVT) is the real deal. The solution makes it possible to forward serial devices over the network, thus making the remote access to any commercial bakery equipment possible. EPVT is equipped with the capability to create a limitless number of virtual COM ports (which are perfect models of real ports) in any given control system. Remote bakery equipment, when connected via COM ports, will be recognized and accessed by a control mechanism as though it has a physical connection established with the controller. 

### Eltima Port Virtualization Technology
By adopting the use of EPVT, the control hardware or software will communicate with the product lines over the network, automatically exchanging serial signals. For example, a PLC will have the ability to receive sensor signals from the baking conveyor with no glitches whatsoever. In turn, the production line responds to pan changes quickly and accurately. 

### Significant benefits of [Eltima PVT Integration into bakery](https://www.eltima.com/industrial-bakery-equipment-ports-virtualization/) production lines: 

For an enterprise, the adoption of Eltima Port Virtualization Technology is a good move towards achieving automation in their entire production line. EPVT allows software/hardware developers for the management of conveyor lines to make significant improvements in their product's functionality. Also, EPVT lets you achieve the following: 
* You can present your solution in a distinctive way such that you beat the competition in your industry 
* Break into new markets, boost product sales, and significantly increase company's revenue. 
* The technology can be designed to integrate well with any OS and can come with some custom features tailored to the product line requirements
