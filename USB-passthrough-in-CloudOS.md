Cloud computing technology - USB access integration
======================================================
***
Cloud computing is the process of using networks of remote servers hosted online to store, process, and manage data, instead of a PC or local server storage. Cloud OS has evolved to become an innovation to reckon with due to the ever-increasing demands of digital innovations users. Due to the convince and flexibility that cloud computing provides, and avoiding the issues of developing and managing a computer base, independent users and companies now prefer to make use of this innovation, just to make data processing easier and faster. Third party servers or independently owned cloud service providers are always reliable when it comes to providing accessible and swift cloud services solution. Cloud OS is usually very easy to use, the browser mostly carries all the necessary features required for a smooth operation. With the use of cloud computing, there is no requirement for more or other special purpose computer systems in place, thereby increasing efficiency while reducing the cost of operation.  

***Problems currently challenging cloud services subscribers:***

Problems are quite inevitable in almost all sectors in life and digital innovation world, with the ever-increasing demand for cloud services, the challenging part is that users find it difficult to manage and operate their RS232 or local USB device while making uses of the cloud software. Users can’t fully utilize the primary features of all gadget connected to the host cloud PC. This means gadgets like gamepads, 3d mouse, printer, fax, and so on can’t function properly while using the cloud OS. In order to eliminate these challenges, we need to incorporate the ability to remotely access and control the USB devices connected to the cloud PC. 


**How do we do Solve these Challenges?:**

Now with the use of our [Eltima Port Virtualization Technology](https://www.eltima.com/access-usb-in-the-cloud-technology/), the challenges faced by cloud users will be a thing of the past. This innovative technology allows cloud OS user to easily access and operate all local USB devices and other devices connect to the cloud hot PC. This is done in a way that devices connected to the cloud PC will be seen and access just like connecting them to a conventional computing system. This makes it possible for Cloud PC users to select cloud services providers that incorporate the use and operation of USB devices on their cloud system over those that do not support this functionality. This means that any cloud service provider that incorporates this functionality into its cloud infrastructure has an upper hand wit when compared to other competitors that do not.
