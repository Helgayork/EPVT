Cloud computing technology - USB access integration
======================================================

Cloud computing is the process of using networks of remote servers hosted online to store, process, and manage data, instead of a PC or local server storage. Cloud OS is the answer to the ever-increasing demands of digital innovations users. Due to the convince and flexibility that cloud computing provides, and avoiding the issues of developing and managing a computer base, independent users and companies now prefer to make use of this innovation, just to make data processing easier and faster. Third party servers or independently owned cloud service providers work properly and allow to work with remote devices and apps. 

Cloud OS is usually very easy to use, the browser mostly carries all the necessary features required for a smooth operation. With the use of cloud computing, there is no requirement for more or other special purpose computer systems in place, thereby increasing efficiency while reducing costs.  

***Problems currently challenging cloud services subscribers:***

Problems are quite inevitable in almost all sectors in life and digital innovation world, with the increasing demand for cloud services, the challenging part is that users find it difficult to manage and operate their serial or USB devices during the work in the Cloud PC. Users canâ€™t use the full functionality of USB devices connected to the host machine from the Cloud Desktop. This means that gamepads, 3d mouse, printer, camera won't function properly while using the cloud OS.
