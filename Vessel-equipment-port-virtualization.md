Benefits of integrating virtualization technology to the vessel software
========================================================================
 
Technological advances are made to modern vessels every year. Vessel management software has made it possible for remote  interaction with many of the modern devices. Navigation, deep-sea research, and many of the vessel’s operational tasks can be monitored and controlled remotely. Crew members are trained to use ship maintenance software and the specialized equipment required for the safe operation of their vessel. The living and working condition of the modern seaman have been radically altered by the introduction of automation and mechanization to the shipping industry.
 
 
### Technology and automation have been employed as solutions to many tasks, including:
 
* Surveying and exploration: locating and observing sunken objects, monitoring of underwater structures and communication;
* Under-ice operations: installing cables and pipelines as well as maintaining the necessary lighting systems;
* Oceanographic research: monitoring of ocean temperatures and currents;
* Exploration and development of underwater oil and gas reserves;
* Geological exploration: Seabed mapping through photo, video and acoustic profiling, topographic inspection;
* Ecological monitoring: study of ecosystem damage and populations of marine life;
* Military applications: surveillance, placement of underwater mines, and other automated military functions.
 
 
## Challenges of Remote Communication
 
The process of developing data collection technology for military, commercial, and research vessels is time-consuming and complex. To provide effective data collection and analysis, ships need to be outfitted with a many pieces of specialized equipment. Communication with these devices is usually enacted through serial RS232 and RS485 connections. Transfer of data around the vessel would entail the installation of miles of cables. This is an inefficient solution due to the inflexibility of the cables as well as the time and cost of installation.
