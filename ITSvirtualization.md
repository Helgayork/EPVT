How to improve Transportation software functionality - ITS with Virtualization technology
============================================================================================

One of the hallmarks of a modern city infrastructure is the presence of a highly developed and efficient transportation system. Current advanced network technologies can equip the existing transportation system with a degree of intelligence allowing it to more effectively exchange and analyze data, interact with other smart components, and respond rapidly to emergency situations. Today’s transportation systems are employing dedicated transportation software to meet the city’s passenger and freight traffic requirements.
The collection of technologies, computer platforms, and applications that are employed to provide benefits to public and commercial transportation is known as an intelligent transportation system (ITS).
Also known as a “smart” transportation system, an ITS is made up of many interconnected automated systems such as speed cameras, car navigation systems, traffic signal control, parking monitoring, variable message signs, and others. These systems come together to solve traffic management tasks. The benefits reaped from these systems include a reduction in automobile accidents, increased security of the transportation sector, and improved efficiency that positively impacts commerce, the public, and the environment.

### The ITS communication problem
Embedded system processors have greatly expanded their capabilities due to advances made in the field of embedded technologies. As they became compatible with PC processors, it became possible to migrate many intelligent processes to the level of embedded systems from the PC level.
The emerging availability of advanced microprocessor modules that are being incorporated into ITS systems allow interaction with real-time operating systems and sophisticated software applications. Combined with data analytics, numerous dedicated applications have enjoyed expanded capabilities. Some examples of these are ticket management, transportation pricing, traffic light control, traffic monitoring, and fleet management software.
One of the primary goals of an intelligent transportation system is to improve the rider or commuter experience by improved routing. This is accomplished through the collection, transmission, and analysis of traffic related data. To facilitate this data movement, ITS developers strive to create effective remote device management and control solutions.  
The nature of ITS hardware demands that many devices are located remotely. Connecting these devices over a network by using USB and COM ports so they can be shared and accessed from a single command center is critical for a successful system. A tool that will facilitate this connectivity is dedicated port redirection technology that can forward USB and serial port data over the Internet.

The way EPVT improves transportation systems
--------------------------------------------
Eltima Port Virtualization Technology (EPVT) offers a unique solution to the problem of connecting and sharing USB and COM-based devices over networks. You can redirect device traffic across your LAN or the Internet using EPVT. This allows remote client machines to interact with network connected devices as if they were physically connected to the device.
ITS developers can harness this technology to enact a fully-automated transportation system by [integrating EPVT into their ITS software](https://www.eltima.com/intelligence-transportation-systems-port-virtualization-technology.html) or the operating systems of the connected ITS devices.
Eltima Port Redirection Technology makes it possible to simultaneously collect data from all of your network attached devices, mange them, and interact with the flow of data.
EPVT enables all communications that occur in a traffic monitoring system to be operated on and controlled from any remote location. Another feature of EPVT is its ability to permit secure data exchange with USB and serial apps, such as dedicated trucking, logistics, and transport software, that are running on remote computers.
 
EPVT is easily integrated with any operating system and can be customized to meet your specific requirements. The specialists at Eltima Software will help you develop a custom solution based on their advanced Port Redirection Technology that can encompass an unlimited number of simultaneous connection.

### The benefits EPVT provides for developers of intelligent transportation systems and specialized transportation system software applications.
* Eltima Port Virtualization Technology enables unlimited remote devices to be simultaneously connected to any system and gives them the ability to transfer unlimited amounts of data.
* EPVT allows networked devices to be accessed wirelessly from a single point of control. This eliminates the need for expensive and bulky cabling to enable device communication. Management of signaling equipment is one area that greatly benefits from this feature of EPVT.
* Eltima’s Port Redirection Solution enables  developers of intelligent transportation systems to significantly reduce the cost of development by integrating a deployable solution to solve the issue of remotely controlling transportation equipment.
